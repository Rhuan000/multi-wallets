# Complex Contract in Solidity

This contract was developed to give me more control and to avoid paying high taxes on each transaction. I am trying to achieve the lowest possible tax value while maintaining the main functions:

- Check if the tax is at the value you want.
- Verify that it is not a honeypot.
- Perform transactions to multiple wallets at once.
- Allow transfers to specified addresses.
